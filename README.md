## üìñ About The Project

A vast segment of the Indian population remains excluded from the formal credit system due to a lack of traditional financial history. A.D.I.T.I. directly addresses this issue with an innovative, two-sided FinTech platform that uses a dual-AI engine to provide fair and transparent credit assessments.

For customers, it offers an interactive chatbot to build a credit profile from the ground up and receive an AI-generated action plan. For bank employees, it delivers a real-time analytics dashboard with AI-powered summaries to enable faster, more insightful decision-making.

## üöÄ Getting Started

This project consists of two main parts: the Frontend Prototype and the Backend Model Scripts.

### Project Structure

```
/ADITI-Project/
|-- /frontend/
|   |-- index.html
|   |-- style.css
|
|-- /dataset/
|   |-- aditi_training_dataset_faker.csv
|
|-- /backend/
|   |-- model.ipynb (or train_model.py)
|   |-- predict.ipynb (or predict_score.py)
|   |-- aditi_model.pkl
|
|-- README.md
```

### 1. Frontend Prototype (The User Interface)

The `/frontend/index.html` file is a fully functional prototype.
1.  Navigate to the `/frontend` directory.
2.  Open `index.html` in a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

### 2. Backend Model Scripts (The AI Engine)

The Python scripts demonstrate the data processing and model training pipeline.

1.  **Setup:**
    * Navigate to the backend folder: `cd backend`
    * Install required libraries: `pip install pandas xgboost scikit-learn joblib numpy`

2.  **Train the Model:**
    * From the `/backend/` folder, run the `model.ipynb` notebook (or `python train_model.py`). This will use the dataset from `../dataset/` and save a new `aditi_model.pkl` file inside the `/backend/` folder.

3.  **Run a Prediction:**
    * From the `/backend/` folder, run the `predict.ipynb` notebook (or `python predict_score.py`). This will load the trained model and predict scores for two sample users.
